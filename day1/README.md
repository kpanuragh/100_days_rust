# Day 1 Challenge: Getting Started with Rust

Welcome to the Day 1 challenge of the 100 Days of Rust Challenge! In this challenge, we will focus on getting started with Rust and setting up the development environment.

## Challenge Task
Your task for today is to complete the following steps:

1. Install Rust: If you haven't already, install Rust on your machine by following the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Verify Rust Installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Rust is installed properly:

''rustc --version''

3. Set Up a New Rust Project: Use Cargo, Rust's package manager, to set up a new Rust project. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run the following command:

''cargo new my_project_name''

4. Build and Run the Project: Navigate into the project directory using `cd my_project_name`. Then, use Cargo to build and run the project with the following command:

''cargo run''

5. Modify the Code: Open the project in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and make some changes to the code in the `src/main.rs` file. Feel free to experiment with Rust syntax, print statements, or basic calculations.

6. Test Your Changes: After making the modifications, save the file and run the project again with `cargo run` to see the changes in action.
